Creating a static page using HTML and CSS
This assignment is designed to help you prepare for your midterm exam. You may do
this assignment in groups of 2 people or individually.
In this assignment, you are asked to create a product page in an online shop using
proper HTML and CSS. The use of CSS to style your websites in a way it’s appealing to
the user is very important.
Your page should include:
- Logo and name of the online shop

- At least one picture of the product
- Some text to describe the product
- A list pointing out different characteristics of the product
- Buttons to choose between different variations of the product in terms of color,
size, model, etc (based on the product you choose to present)
- A button to add the product to the cart
- A button to view the cart
- A search field for searching for new items
- A navigation bar to navigate to other pages (or at least the main page of the
shop)
- A section promoting similar/suggested products
Pay attention that:
● Your page should be fully static, meaning that the buttons are not yet
implemented, but the design should be complete.
● In creating your website, you might need to use more html elements and css
properties than explained in the lectures. You can use your textbook or
w3schools to learn more about them.
● You should lay out your content using <div> tags and position them as you see
fit. The number of columns and exact layout is up to you.
● Proper implementation of the tags and contents is very important. Think about
exceptional cases when the pictures cannot be loaded, etc
